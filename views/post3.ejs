            <strong>Muay Thai,</strong> which translates to “Thai Boxing”, is
            the national sport of Thailand. It is a martial art with roots
            originating from military use dating back to around the 13th century
            during the time of the Sukhothai Kingdom.
          </p>
          <p>
            Muay Thai is known as the “Art of 8 limbs” because it makes use of 8
            points of contact namely, punches, elbows, knees and kicks. This
            differs it from other stand-up combat sports such as boxing (2
            points - fists) and karate (4 points - fists and feet).
          </p>
          <p>
            Today, Muay Thai is practised and competed not only in Thailand, but
            also all around the world.

            “Muay” translates to mean “boxing” in Thai, so Muay Thai is
            literally Thai boxing. Taking elements from Muay Boran, the
            traditional Thai martial arts, Muay Thai as a modern combat sport
            was first formalized in the early 20th century. The sport was
            influenced by British boxing where codified rules and the boxing
            ring were put in place. During this period, fighters also ditched
            wrapping hands with ropes (“Kard Chuek”) and began wearing boxing
            gloves in competitions.

          <p>
            Muay Thai is a stand-up striking sport, with two competitors in the
            ring throwing punches, elbows, knees and kicks at each other.
            Clinching, sweeps and throws are also allowed. Besides the 8-point
            contact, a key difference between Muay Thai and many other stand-up
            combat sports is its emphasis on traditional elements such as the
            pre-fight dance ritual known as Wai Kru Ram Muay, the head dress
            (Mongkon) and the Sarama music that accompanies each fight.

            <strong>Muay Thai History</strong> The history of Muay Thai can be
            traced historically to the Sukhothai dynasty of Thailand around the
            13th century. As recorded in Thai history, the first Thai army was
            born out of a need to defend the kingdom and soldiers were taught
            both armed and unarmed combat. Over time, the evolution of this
            martial art gave us Muay Boran and Muay Thai as we know it today.
          </p>
          <p>
            Due to wars with neighboring kingdoms and tribes over the centuries,
            Muay Thai became a way of life for the people of Siam (as Thailand
            used to be called). One of the most famous stories of Muay Thai came
            via the great Nai Khanom Tom, during the Ayutthaya period. The tale
            narrates how Nai Khanom Tom defeated 9 Burmese fighters, one after
            another, during his imprisonment after the Siam kingdom was under
            siege. The historical event (half steeped in myth) is now celebrated
            as Muay Thai day which takes place every year on March 17th.

            During the Rattanakosin Kingdom era (around 18th-early 20th
            century), Muay Thai was formally became a national sport where rules
            and regulations were introduced.
          </p>

            <strong>Modern Muay Thai</strong> Muay Thai has grown over years
            since around World War I period to become a combat sport loved and
            practised all around the world. Modern Muay Thai encompasses
            elements of traditional boxing including the use of padded boxing
            gloves, 3 to 5 rounds with time limit, defined rules and take place
            within a ring (squared platform).
          </p>
          <p>
            Muay Thai takes much of its strikes and techniques from ancient Muay
            Thai, also commonly known as Muay Boran. Muay Boran was created
            primarily for hand-to-hand combat during warfare. As the sport
            evolves, dangerous techniques from Muay Boran that may be deadly
            have become forbidden in Muay Thai such as strikes to the joints or
            back of the head.
          </p>

            Other than variations of punches as seen in western boxing (e.g.
            jabs, crosses, hooks, uppercuts), kicks, elbows and knee strikes are
            used in Muay Thai. Clinching, sweeps and throws are also used
            strategically in modern Muay Thai to make it an all-rounded combat
            art. Due to the 8-point contact, the sport has proven to be one of
            the most effective stand-up striking art and practised by many mixed
            martial artists. <span style="color: orange"> ~ yokkao</span>
