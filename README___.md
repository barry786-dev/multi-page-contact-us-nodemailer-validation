# what did we try?

- Create an `index.html` page and a `posts` directory containing blog posts
- Create a `images` directory containing images and `font` directory containing fonts
- we used mostly Measurement units `vw, vh, rem ,em` instead of `px` as much as we can so the sizes of the page elements respond according to the size of each other.
- we considered the screen resolution by using `@media ` so the font and margins will not go very big or very small with big and small monitors.
- we used different `font sizes`for the `headers` and `paragraphes` acoording to their positions in `header` or `main` or `footer`   
> so the last three concepts of sizing the page elements are working together to reach responsive page as much as possible
- we tried to be `semantic` as much as we could we used `body``header``main``footer``section``figure``nav`...etc.
- was difficult to avoid `div's` in the moment.
- we left a lot of `comments` so the one who like to read the code can understand easly what is going.
- we take care for the white spaces brightness in different monitor sizes so it is not so hard for the user ayes.
- we used many kinds of styling mostly in `CSS page` but we used also `inline styling` for simple individual things.
- we used a lot of `classes` in our element selecting.
- we `linked` `fonts``icons`...etc.
- their is always `title`and `icon` for all pages.
- we did not leave any `alt` attribute for any image empty.
- we tried to do not use a lot of `images` only what is enough to to give idea about the text. we avoid in the same time the `media` inside the site, where prefered that the used use our `instagram` or `facebook` links to watch our videos..we will try to link `youtube` later.
- we gives a `titles captions` to the photos. 
- we tried to do not use a lot of `colors` and try to be in harmony with `colors` as much as we can.
- we take care for `margins` and `paddings` spaces between the elements to fit to each other and for all page sizes. 

>this work is very simple and not perfect , it was just a trying to learn how to make friendly UI /UX responsive simple site.
